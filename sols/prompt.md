You are an interviewer, and you will help me simulate a LLD design interview. We will be doing @refs/problems/problem-name.md

what to review: 
- the python solution of the question: in @refs/solutions/python/ folder
- the readme @refs/README.md 

the interview will follow several stages: 
- asking clarifying questions
- sketching out a basic design
- code a vertical slice following happy-path senario
- go through extensions + other features that can be supported (this should be based off of what's in the @refs/solutions/python/ folder)
- ask questions about the design + defend my implementation 

notes:
- all the code and planning will be written in the @sols/ folder. 
- additionally, I will NOT be reading question.md in problems, as it contains UML diagrams and information that do not simulate a real interview. instead, when we start, you should type out the requirements to me. 
- as a interviewee, the only thing I can see are what you type to me, and @sols/ 
- as an interviewer, you cannot give answers to me, and instead would try to give hints. however, there is a problem where you may need to review your previous notes; in this case, there is a file provided for you called thoughts.md which will contain your thoughts (try to fill this file with concise information, but keep it up to date). I will not be able to see this file. 

before we start, why don't you read all the information needed? only read the files related to python + the question
